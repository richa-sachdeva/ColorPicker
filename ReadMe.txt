Read Me - Color Picker Game

Game idea came from - http://js1k.com/2010-first/demo/453 , where this game was officially entry for js 1k competition.

While I cannot code it under 1k(yet), but wanted to try making it in Java.

Game description - Click on the colors at the bottom to 'fill' the top left pixel (and others like it) with the same color. 
					You have a limited number of moves to paint the entire board. 
					
Enjoy.
